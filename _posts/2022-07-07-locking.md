Locking files in Linux is tricky - not because it is complex, but complicated due to the many variants.

First of all you have different kinds:
- *mandatory* locks are enforced by the Linux kernel and prevent other processes from opening the file while another process has an exclusive lock. This can easily deadlock the system. Linux supports this on file systems explicitly mounted with option `mand`.
- *advisory* locks require support from all applications: each one has to implement the same mechanism to guarantee proper cooperation.

For *advisory* locks you have multiple types in Linux:
- BSD file lock (<man:flock(2)>)
- POSIX record lock (<man:fnctl(2)>; the simplified version <man:lockf(3)> only supporting *exclusive* locks)
- Open file descriptor (OFD) lock (<man:fcntl(2)>)

Basically they are incompatible with each other and your applications should agree to use only one.

| Variant | Origin | NFS | range | associated | `fork()`  | auto released  |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| BSD     | BSD    | no¹ | file  | open FD    | inherited | last FD closed |
| POSIX   | POSIX  | yes | bytes | pid,inode  | dropped   | any FDs closed |
| OFD     | Linux  | yes | bytes | open FD    | inherited | last FD closed |

## BSD file locks
- only complete files can be locked, not parts
- NFS support may not work, only since Linux 2.6.11 (¹)
- mode change is not atomic
- inherited on `fork()`
- released when last FD is `closed()`

## POSIX record lock
- very strange behavior: lock is associated with `(pid,inode)` tuple
- closing any duplicated file descriptor will release all locks
- `fork()`ed child process does not inherit locks
- does not work well with threads

## Open File Descriptor locks (file-private POSIX locks)
- Linux specific
- released when last FD is `closed()`
- thread may open files themselves and get their own locks

# Python
In Python [fnctl.lockf()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.lockf) is a wrapper using `fcntl.ioctl()` directly.
It is implemented in [CPython:fcntlmodule.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/fcntlmodule.c#L372).
It does not use the implementation from [Glibc:lockf.c](https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/io/lockf.c#L35).
