1. Business Projects: Customers are paying us; managed
2. Internal Projects: Lots of inter-dependant tasks; often not managed

1. Systems thinking: work flowing from left to right as fast possible
2. Amplify feedback loops: increasing the feedback loops from right to left
3. Culture of continual experimentation and learning: is encouraged
