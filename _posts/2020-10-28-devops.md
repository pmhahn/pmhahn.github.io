# Four Types of Work in IT

1. Business Projects: Customers are paying us; managed
2. Internal Projects: Lots of inter-dependant tasks; often not managed
3. Operational Change: Little tasks
4. Unplanned Work: Highest priority, disruptive

# The Five Ideals

1. Locality and Simplicity: You should not depend on work done by others
2. Focus, Flow, and Joy: You should be able to concentrate on your work
3. Improvement of Daily Work: Pay down technical dept
4. Psychological Safety: No fear to talk
5. Customer Focus: core vs. context
