[Bareos](https://www.bareos.org/en/) is a backup software, which was forked from [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/) years ago.
It consists of several services:

* Bareos Director (D) @ TCP:9101: central scheduler to coordinate all activities.
* Bareos File Daemon (FD) @ TCP:9102: service running on each client to backup (and restore) the client.
* Bareos Storage Daemon (SD) @ TCP:9103: storage system to host the backed-up data.
* Bareos Catalog (C): database with data of all backed-up files.
* Bareos Console / WebUI: textual or graphical interface to the Director.
* Bareos Tray-Monitor (TM): Desktop application for monitoring other services.

Connections
===========
They [communicate](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/NetworkSetup.html#network-connections-overview) over the network and use [pair-wise shared secrets](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/CustomizingTheConfiguration.html#names-passwords-and-authorization).

* The Director contacts the File Daemon to initiate the backup (or restore).
* The File Daemon contacts the Storage Daemon and sends it data to it.
  As an [alternative](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/NetworkSetup.html#passive-clients) the connection can be reversed if for example the SD has no public IP address.
* The Console contacts the Director to send it commands.
* The Tray-Monitor can connect to all other services to monitor them directly.
  Each TM is configured to access the Director as a restricted console or the other services as an additional Director with restricted read-only permissions.
* The Director needs access to the Catalog database.

Configuration
=============
The services are configured through files below `/etc/bareos/`.
Either the configuration can be put into a single file `$SERVICE.conf`, or split over multiple fragments `$SERVICE.d/$TYPE/$NAME.conf`.
While the former exists, the later is ignored.
`$NAME` should match `Name = "..."` except for `bareos-fd.d/client/myself.confÂ´.

`Name = "..."` is only important for
* `bareos-dir.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf`
* `bareos-dir.d/console/CONSOLE.conf`
* `tray-monitor.d/monitor/CONSOLE.conf`
as they define the name which mast match the name given in
* `bareos-fd.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf`
* `bareos-sd.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf`
* `tray-monitor.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf`
* `bconsole.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf`

Director
--------
[/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html)
* For each *File Daemon* there must be a matching `Client` section.
* For each *Storage Daemon* there must be a matching `Storage` section.
* For each restricted *Console* and *Tray-Monitor* there must be a matching `Console` section.
* A admin *Console* uses the secret from `Director`.

```
# /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf
Director {
  Name = "DIRECTOR"  # !!!
  Password = "ADMIN-SECRET"  # admin access
}
# /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/console/CONSOLE.conf
Console {
  Name = "CONSOLE"  # !!!
  Password = "CONSOLE-SECRET"  # restricted access
}
# /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/client/CLIENT.conf
Client {
  Name = "CLIENT"
  Address = FILE-DAEMON-ADDRESS
  Password = "FILE-DAEMON-SECRET"
}
# /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/storage/STORAGE.conf
Storage {
  Name = "STORAGE"
  Address = STORAGE-DAEMON-ADDRESS  # public

* For each restricted *Tray-Monitor* there must be an additional `Director` section.

```
# /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf  # always that name
Client {
  Name = "CLIENT"
}
# /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/director/DIRECTOR.conf
Director {
  Name = "DIRECTOR"

* There shoule be one `Monitor` and one `Director` section for the *Director*.
* For each *File Daemon* there can be a matching `Client` section.
* For each *Storage Daemon* there can be a matching `Storage` section.

```
# /etc/bareos/tray-monitor.d/monitor/CONSOLE.conf
