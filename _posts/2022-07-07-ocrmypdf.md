On a regular basis I have to scan some paper documents.
For the scanning I still use [xsane](https://gitlab.com/sane-project/frontend/xsane) (X Scanner Access Now Easy) for that.
Afterwards I used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (GUN Image Manipulation Program) to do the post processing:
- adjust black / white balance to make the background white
- de-speckle some areas

This normally reduced the file size by a factor of 10 from 10 MiB per page to roughly 1 MiB per page.
While it worked for me it was a lot of work, which took its time.

During the last [Mini DebConf Regensburg 2021](https://www.debian.org/) I learned about [OpenPaper.work](https://openpaper.work/de/).
I use it to archive my PDFs, which allows me to tag and find them.
Under the hood it uses [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to convert the pixel-PDFs into searchable PDFs.
But it does not handle the shrinking part.

So I continued my journey and found [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Under the hood it uses [unpaper](https://github.com/unpaper/unpaper) to do some post-processing.
Afterwards `tesseract` is used to do the OCR.

By default it preserved the original PDF, but you can also use it to create a minimized PDF like this:

```
ocrmypdf -l deu --remove-background --deskew --clean --clean-final -O 2 inpud.pdf output.pdf
```
