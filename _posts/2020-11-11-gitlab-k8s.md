Continuing my GitLab and Kubernetes (k8s) odyssey from [k8s @ Debian]({% post_url 2019-08-28-kubernetes-on-debian %}) I've learned two things:

1. DNS problems with Alpine Linux
2. SSL certificate hell

# DNS problems with Alpine Linux

Many Docker images are based on Alpine Linux, which is smaller than most [Debian images]({% post_url 2019-12-03-debian-debootstrap %}).
But the use a different C library names `musl`, which is smaller but more restricted then `glibc`.
Among others it uses a different DNS resolver, which sometimes fails for me.

The symptoms are that the GitLab runner fails the initial `git clone`:

    Getting source from Git repository
    Fetching changes with git depth set to 50...
    Initialized empty Git repository in /builds/work/XXX/.git/
    Created fresh repository.
    fatal: unable to access 'https://git.XXX.XXX.de/XXX/XXX.git/': Could not resolve host: git.XXX.XXX.de

Strangely this does not happen every time, but mostly after the cluster was idle for some time.
Restarting the failed job again manually most often fixed the problem as then the host was resolvable.

There is a [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56903), where the initial DNS lookup is delayed for 5s and more.
I can trigger this with the following command:

```bash
kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never busybox --image=alpine:3.12 -- nslookup git.XXX.XXX.de
...
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
...
```

## Search order

Looking at `/etc/resolv.conf` you will find this:

```
nameserver 169.254.25.10
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local pmhahn.XXX
options ndots:5
```

The `ndots:5` leads to the following (strange) situation:
As `git.XXX.XXX.de` has *less* then 5 dots, the resolver will try to resolve the following URLs:

1. git.XXX.XXX.de.default.svc.cluster.local
2. git.XXX.XXX.de.svc.cluster.local
3. git.XXX.XXX.de.cluster.local
4. git.XXX.XXX.de.pmhahn.XXX
5. git.XXX.XXX.de.

Only the last will succeed, but the other ones will take time.

This should be avoidable by appending a trailing dot to the URL like `https://git.XXX.XXX.de./`, but did not work for me.
Using `clone_url = "https://git.XXX.XXX.de./"` in `config.tomp` did not improve the situation.

## IPv6

Our environment is IPv6 ready, but not every host has a IPv6 address.
Namely our git-server does *not* have one.

When the name is resolved both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are queried.
The `musl` DNS resolver seems to perform the in *parallel* re-using the *same* UDP socket.
There seems to be a [known problem](https://tech.xing.com/a-reason-for-unexplained-connection-timeouts-on-kubernetes-docker-abd041cf7e02) with this as the Linux connection tracking code is confused by this.
The `NXDOMAIN` answer for IPv6 is then used also for IPv4 and [DNS resolution fails](https://blog.quentin-machu.fr/2018/06/24/5-15s-dns-lookups-on-kubernetes/).

## NodeLocal DNSCache

I've already enabled [NodeLocal DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/), which was recommended by [this](https://tech.findmypast.com/k8s-dns-lookup/) article.
Initially this looked promising, but now the problems are back.

## My hack

For the GitLab k8s runner there currently is no way to overwrite the `ndots:5`.
Therefore I setup a [pre_clone_script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/-/issues/109) to rewrite the `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```yaml
envVars:
  - name: RUNNER_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT
    value: 'd="$(grep ^nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)";echo "$d" >/etc/resolv.conf'
```

This improved the situation for some time, but again I see failures.

Reviewing the `nslookup` experiment from above I've now extended to this:
```yaml
envVars:
  - name: RUNNER_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT
    value: 'd="$(grep ^nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)";echo "$d" >/etc/resolv.conf;for i in 1 2 3 4 5;do getent hosts git.XXX.XXX.de&&break;done'
```

which is supposed to retry DNS resolution 5 times **before** the real job starts.
Probably this will not work for the helper image, but lets see.

PS: My k8s cluster is using [calico CNI](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/).

# SSL certificate hell

You should secure your connections by using `https://`.
But this is more complicated if you have a private installation and are using self-signed SSL certificates.

1. `dockerd` will eventually pull images from you private registry.
2. Your GitLab k8s runner needs to communicate with your GitLab server.
3. Scripts running in your pipeline may want to communicate with those services.

Getting this to work in all situations is a long process:

## Docker on host

> ERROR: Job failed: image pull failed: Back-off pulling image "docker-registry.XXX.XXX.de/phahn/ucs-minbase:latest"

```bash
install -m 0444 ucs-root-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
update-ca-certificates
systemctl restart docker.service
```

## Docker in docker

To be able to build new Docker images with GitLab k8s runners, which are themselves running as Docker containers, I'm using [Docker in Docker](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html#using-dockerdind) (dind).
Normally you can directly use the Docker image `docker:dind` for that, but that one does not have your CA certificate.
Therefore I build my own with the following `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM docker:dind
COPY ucs-root-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

The image is built by this:

```bash
docker build -t docker-registry.XXX.XXX.de/ucs/docker:dind  .
```

It is used in `.gitlab-ci.yaml` like this:

```yaml
.docker:
  services:
    - name: docker-registry.XXX.XXX.de/ucs/docker:dind
      alias: docker
  variables:
    DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
    DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  tags:
    - docker
  image: docker:stable

some job:
  extends: .docker
  script:
    - docker build .
```


## k8s GitLab runner

A k8s GitLab runner consists of [multiple containers](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html#workflow):

1. The permanent container registered with GitLab
2. A container for each build job as specified with [image:](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#image).
3. Additional containers for the services as specified with [services:](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#services).
4. A [helper container](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#helper-image) to handle Git, artifacts and cache operations.

Previously I was using this in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
envVars:
  - name: CI_SERVER_TLS_CA_FILE
    value: /home/gitlab-runner/.gitlab-runner/certs/ucs-root-ca.crt
  - name: CONFIG_FILE
    value: /home/gitlab-runner/.gitlab-runner/config.toml
```

This worked for cloning and most other operations, but failed for [LFS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27067):

> LFS: Get https://git.XXX.XXX.de/XXX/XXX/ansible-playbooks.git/gitlab-lfs/objects/e16be6c5cd3e3b7e79dd09b3dd0662cdb4d70df7d1d38e56c3a6504e132e9f06: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

For the `helper` you need an additional [trick](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/tls-self-signed.html) to insert the CA certificate.
Using [Volumes](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html#secret-volumes) you can easily do that:

```yaml
runners:
  config: |
    [[runners]]
      clone_url = "https://git.XXX.XXX.de./"
      [runners.kubernetes]
        image = "docker-registry.XXX.XXX.de/phahn/ucs-minbase:latest"
        imagePullPolicy = "always"
        privileged = true
        [[runners.kubernetes.volumes.secret]]
          name = "ca"
          mount_path = "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/"
          read_only = true
          [runners.kubernetes.volumes.secret.items]
            "ucs-root-ca.crt" = "ca.crt"
```

Here `ca` referred to the k8s secret, which I already use for `kubespray`:

```console
# kubectl describe secret ca
Name:         ca
Namespace:    default
...
Type:  Opaque
...
Data
====
ucs-root-ca.crt:  2537 bytes
```


## Pipeline

For Debian based images inside the pipeline:

```bash
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install -q --assume-yes ca-certificates
install -m 0444 ucs-root-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
update-ca-certificates
```
